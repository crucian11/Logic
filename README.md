# Logic
Provides a convenient way of representing logic expressions. It also allows you to perform basic operations with logic expressions(generate a truth table, find the solution with a given tuple of values).
##Getting started
To get started, you should just instantiate a LogicExpression class by passing string representation into its constructor:
```c#
LogicExpression expression = new LogicExpression("p AND q");
```
